# Ricochet Waterdrops

## Developer Quickstart
After cloning the repository use NPM to install dependancies including Hardhat, Tenderly, Superfluid, and others.
```
npm install
```
Run the tests to make sure everything is set up properly:
```
npx hardhat test test/Waterdrop.ts
npx hardhat test test/ConditionalWaterdrop.ts
```
Now you're ready to do development. Run the tests frequently while doing your development to avoid making breaking changes.
